## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox and Media queries

### What I learned

During this challenge I practice using Semantic HTML instead of just a bunch of divs. I also seperated my CSS into sections to make it easier to edit and read. I learned how to make my websites change between mobile and desktop using breakpoints with media queries.

### Continued development

In future projects I want to have better control over the responsiveness of my layouts using something like Clamp in css as well as practice Grid. I would also like to better my understanding of accessibility and make sure my code is up to par for screen readers. Lastly, I want to start dipping my toes into interactivity and JS.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Webdocs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) - This article helped me in understanding media queries and how to use them.
- [Kevil Powell CSS Units](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5wpD9Ov_To&t=1s&ab_channel=KevinPowell) - This video helped me understand when I should use relative units and how.
- [MDN WebDocs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/letter-spacing) - This helped me with letter spacing.
